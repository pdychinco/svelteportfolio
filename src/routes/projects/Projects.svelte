        <img src={deepracer} alt="AWS DeepRacer Student League"/>
        <p>I built an AWS DeepRacer model using Python and Reinforcement Learning that allows the DeeRacer car to go around a track autonomously. My model's lap time on the virtual March 2022 Global
            Student league track qualified me as one of the top Canadian Student racers in Canada. I was invited to compete in the Ottawa 2022 Canadian Student Wilcard Race on a live track, where I
            placed 9th.</p>

        <img src={flower} alt="Flower"/>
        <p>I coded Python script to read pictures and classify various species of flowers. After I created my own classifier and added it to a pretrained model. I had to modify the hyperparameters which resulted in a validation accuracy of 78%. Finally I created a command line tool to train and predict flowers using my classifier.</p>

        <p>Web application to help users decide which restaurant to eat at based on user's survey results. I focused primarily on Javascript & backend development to create core features for the app, such as the restaurant survey and restaurant roulette. Created with two other BCIT CST 1st term students for COMP 1800.</p>
